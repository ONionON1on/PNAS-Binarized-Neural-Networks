# Progressive Neural Architecture Search with Binarized Neural Networks

**This project combines the architecture search strategy from [Progressive Neural Architecture Search][1] with the search space of Binarized Neural Networks [Binarized Neural Networks: Training Deep Neural Networks with Weights and Activations Constrained to +1 or -1][2].**
